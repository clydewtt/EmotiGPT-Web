## Project Selection/Track:
Develop an Emotion AI - ChatGPT Application

## Description
EmotiGPT is an advanced AI-powered conversational agent that integrates Emotion AI with GPT-4 to create a more empathetic and responsive communication experience. The application detects emotions from both textual input and facial expressions, enabling it to respond appropriately to the user’s emotional state. This project explores how the integration of Emotion AI into a conversational model enhances human-computer interaction by making it more personalized and emotionally intelligent.

## Overall Objective
The objective of EmotiGPT is to develop an AI-driven chatbot that understands and processes natural language, recognizes emotional cues, and responds accordingly. By detecting emotions through both text analysis and facial recognition, EmotiGPT aims to be a valuable tool for applications requiring emotional sensitivity, such as mental health support, customer service, and education.

## Features
- **Emotion Detection from Text**: Analyze text inputs to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more, providing responses that align with the user's emotional state.
- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: Identify emotions from facial expressions using advanced recognition algorithms, enhancing the emotional context in conversations.
- **Emotion-Responsive Dialogue**: Tailor chatbot responses based on the detected emotions for more empathetic and nuanced interactions.
- **Multimodal Interaction**: Combine both textual and facial emotion data to create a comprehensive emotional profile of the user in real-time.
- **Adaptable for Various Use Cases**: Suitable for mental health, customer service, and educational support, EmotiGPT’s emotion detection capabilities can be adapted across industries.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Enable the chatbot to speak responses, providing an audio component to interactions.
- **Speech-to-Text Integration**: Allow users to speak to the chatbot, making interactions more natural through voice.
- **Chat History**: Store conversation history in a database for later retrieval and analysis.
- **Login/Signup**: Secure user authentication for personalized interactions.

## Impact
EmotiGPT revolutionizes AI interaction by making conversations more human-like and emotionally aware. By recognizing and responding to emotions, EmotiGPT improves user satisfaction, builds trust, and provides more effective support across different domains. This project lays the groundwork for future advancements in emotionally intelligent AI, contributing to the development of more empathetic and user-centric technologies.

## Proposed Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React, WebRTC (for real-time video communication), shadcn/ui (component library)
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Python, OpenAI API, WebSockets
- **Text Sentiment Analysis**: OpenAI API or Hugging Face Transformers
- **Facial Emotion Recognition**: OpenCV
- **Database (optional)**: Firebase or MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Vercel
